# LeetCode Practice Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! üåü

This repository is organized to help you easily navigate through the solutions I've implemented for various LeetCode problems. The solutions are grouped by difficulty levels, and each problem is contained within its respective folder.

## Directory Structure

- **Problems**
  - **Easy**: Solutions to problems that are relatively straightforward and require basic problem-solving skills.
  - **Medium**: Solutions to problems that are moderately challenging, often requiring a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.
  - **Hard**: Solutions to the most challenging problems that often require complex algorithms and optimization techniques.

Each problem is organized as follows:
```
Problems/
  |-- Easy/
  |   |-- <Problem Name>/
  |   |   |-- Solution.cs
  |
  |-- Medium/
  |   |-- <Problem Name>/
  |   |   |-- Solution.cs
  |
  |-- Hard/
      |-- <Problem Name>/
          |-- Solution.cs
```
